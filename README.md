# Abaqus-VUMAT-Isotropic-Elasticity-Isothermal-Suboutine
The VUMAT subroutine in Abaqus provides an effective approach for simulating materials that are not adequately captured by the standard Abaqus material library. In this study, we applied this subroutine to analyze a 3D isotropic isothermal beam. Further projects related to this domain can be explored at the link provided below.
