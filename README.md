# Abaqus-VUMAT-Isotropic-Elasticity-Isothermal-Suboutine
The VUMAT subroutine in Abaqus provides an effective approach for simulating materials that are not adequately captured by the standard Abaqus material library. In this study, we applied this subroutine to analyze a 3D isotropic isothermal beam. Further projects related to this domain can be explored at the link provided below.

The case study, depicted in the accompanying figure, involves a 3D anisotropic isothermal beam. The analysis was conducted twice: first using Abaqus's built-in material model and then with the VUMAT subroutine. A comparison of the stress distributions revealed identical results.

Additionally, a free PDF providing an in-depth explanation of the UMAT subroutine and related workshops is also available and comes highly recommended.
